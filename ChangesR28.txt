* lines 545-565: in SETUP check value of rPARiMax (150<rPARiMax<770 uE ==> 2800<Linoon<45000 Hz)
		 and change ConMax accordingly.

Due to non negligible exp(-SAC*Con^2*w)
1. At low Con (<7.5), not enough light is supplied to  
    fulfill constant <L>/Con
2. One MUST recalculate PARimax for each Con 
    lower than 7.5 mg/L (multipying by 1-exp(...))

* line 2817: at the expression for calculating rPARimax (at the denominator) - changed ConMax to Chla
